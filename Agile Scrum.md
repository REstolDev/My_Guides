# Module 1

# Section 1: Agile philosophy
Define of the Agile philosophy, describe the characteristics of agile, and explain the philosophy of the Agile Manifesto.

## What is Agile?
Agile is an iterative approach to project management that allows teams to be responsive and deliver value to their customers quickly. Unlike other planning approaches, where we plan out an entire year's worth of work, with agile, we plan out small increments and get feedback from the customer to see if they like what we're doing, adjusting as we go along.

## Characteristics of Agile
Agile emphasizes the following characteristics:

### Adaptive Planning
Agile doesn't plan out an entire year but focuses on small iterations to deliver something of value to the customer and gather feedback. This allows for evolutionary development.

### Early Delivery
Early delivery is a key component of being agile. Putting something in the customer's hands and getting their feedback is essential.

### Continuous Improvement
Agile allows for continuous improvement as a team and in the product. Feedback from customers helps in making improvements.

### Responsiveness to Change
Agile enables teams to respond to changes quickly as they occur, as customer requirements evolve. Agile does not rely on planning too far in advance.

## The Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto lays out the core values of agile development. It states:

- We have come to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

The key point is that, while there is value in the items on the right, the items on the left are valued more. It doesn't mean that processes, tools, documentation, or contracts are unimportant; it means that interaction, working software, collaboration, and responsiveness to change are prioritized.

## Conclusion
Agile software development is an iterative approach that adheres to the Agile Manifesto's core values. It emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and transparency. Additionally, it involves small cross-functional teams, co-located and self-organizing, to build what is needed, not just what was planned, in response to changing customer needs.



# Seccion 2: Introduction

# The Waterfall Approach
The Waterfall approach is a traditional method of software development, characterized by a series of sequential phases:

## Requirements Phase
- Gathering requirements to ensure alignment with the customer's needs.

## Design Phase
- Architects design the entire system based on the gathered requirements.

## Coding Phase
- Developers start coding based on the design.

## Integration Phase
- Modules are integrated for the first time.

## Testing Phase
- Testing is conducted to find and fix bugs.

## Deployment Phase
- Finally, the software is deployed into production.

### Problems with Waterfall
- Lack of provision for change.
- No intermediate delivery.
- Each phase must end before the next begins.
- Potential for information loss and blockages.
- Mistakes found late in the process are costly.
- Long lead times between initiation and delivery.

# Extreme Programming (XP) Approach
Extreme Programming is an Agile methodology introduced in 1996 by Kent Beck, focusing on iterative and rapid development:

## XP Values
1. Simplicity: Do what is necessary, and nothing more.
2. Communication: Encourage team-wide communication and collaboration.
3. Feedback: Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement.
4. Respect: Respect all team members and their contributions.
5. Courage: Be honest about estimates and commitments.

# Kanban
Kanban, originating from Japanese manufacturing systems, emphasizes the following core principles:

## Core Principles
1. Visualize the Workflow: Make the work visible for better management.
2. Limit the Work in Progress: Avoid overloading individuals with too many tasks.
3. Manage and Enhance the Flow: Continuously improve the flow of work.
4. Make Policies Explicit: Clearly define process policies and the definition of "done."
5. Continuously Improve: Gather feedback and continuously enhance the process.

# Section 4: Understanding Scrum

## Introduction
- After watching this section, you'll be able to:
  - Distinguish between Agile and Scrum.
  - Define the key characteristics of the Scrum methodology.
  - Describe the steps in the Scrum process.

## Agile vs. Scrum
- Agile and Scrum are often used interchangeably, but there's a distinction:
  - Agile is a philosophy, non-prescriptive, a way of approaching work.
  - Scrum is a methodology, prescriptive, a structured way to work with agility.

## Understanding Scrum
- Scrum is a management framework for incremental product development.
- It emphasizes small, self-managing teams.
- Scrum provides roles, rules, and artifacts.
- It uses fixed-length increments known as sprints.
- Goal: building a potentially shippable increment each sprint.

    "Easy to understand, difficult to master." - Scrum is deceptively challenging.
    Advice: If you're new, hire someone experienced to guide you.

## The Sprint
- A sprint is an iteration through the design, code, test, deploy cycle.
- Every sprint should have a clear goal.
- Sprints are typically two weeks long.
- Keep them short to respond to changes effectively.

## Steps in the Scrum Process
- Product Backlog: A comprehensive list of everything to do.
- Backlog Refinement: Preparing stories for sprint planning.
- Planning Meeting: Creating a sprint backlog.
- Sprint Backlog: Smaller selection of stories for the next two weeks.
- Daily Scrum: Daily stand-ups with three key questions.
- Goal: Achieve a valuable, shippable increment.

## Agile Development
- Agile development is iterative.
- Cycles of design, code, test, deploy in every sprint.
- Deployment and customer feedback are crucial.
- Continuous refinement is key.

In this section, you learn that Scrum is a methodology following the Agile philosophy. It prescribes structure through defined roles, meetings, rules, and artifacts. It emphasizes small, self-organizing teams using fixed-length iterations (sprints) and aims for potentially shippable product increments.

# Section 5: Roles in Scrum

## Introduction
- After watching this section, you'll be able to:
  - List the three roles of Scrum.
  - Explain what a product owner does.
  - Explain what a Scrum master does.
  - Explain what a Scrum team does.

## The Product Owner
- Scrum consists of three core roles, starting with the product owner:
  - Holds a clear vision.
  - Makes crucial decisions.
  - Has the authority to pivot or persevere.
- Note: Distinguish between a product manager and a product owner.
- Responsibilities:
  - Represents stakeholder interests.
  - Articulates the product vision.
  - Determines requirements.
  - Maintains the product backlog.
  - Accepts or rejects each product increment.

## The Scrum Master
- The Scrum master plays a pivotal role:
  - Facilitates the Scrum process.
  - Should ideally be the most knowledgeable team member about Scrum.
  - Responsibilities:
    - Acts as a mentor.
    - Creates a self-organizing team environment.
    - Shields the team from external interferences.
    - Helps resolve impediments.
    - Enforces time boxes.
    - Captures empirical data.
    - Has no management authority over the team.

## The Scrum Team
- The Scrum team, also known as the development team:
  - A cross-functional group.
  - Responsible for delivering the product increment.
  - Characteristics:
    - Self-organizing.
    - All members are equal in roles.
    - Self-assign work.
    - Negotiate commitments with the product owner sprint by sprint.
    - High autonomy in determining how to meet their commitments.

In this section, you learn about the roles within the Scrum framework. The product owner represents stakeholders, articulates the product vision, and decides on priorities, requirements, and readiness for shipping. The Scrum master mentors the team, fosters a cooperative environment, and removes impediments. The Scrum team is small, dedicated, cross-functional, self-managing, and has autonomy in achieving their commitments.

# Section 6: Scrum Artifacts, Events, and Benefits

## Introduction
- Upon completing this section, you will be able to:
  - Describe the three Scrum artifacts.
  - Explain the five Scrum events.
  - Discuss the benefits of Scrum.

## Scrum Artifacts
- Scrum introduces three essential artifacts:
  - **Product Backlog**: A list of all pending product requirements.
  - **Sprint Backlog**: Stories to be executed in the next two weeks (next sprint).
  - **Done Increment**: A completed product increment at the end of a sprint.

## Scrum Events
- Scrum involves five events:
  - **Sprint Planning Meeting**: Planning for the upcoming sprint, with the whole team participating.
  - **Daily Scrum**: Daily stand-up meetings for team synchronization and issue resolution.
  - **Sprint**: The active two-week working period.
  - **Sprint Review**: A demonstration of progress to stakeholders.
  - **Sprint Retrospective**: A reflection on what went well and what to improve for the future.

## Benefits of Scrum
- Scrum offers several advantages:
  - **Higher Productivity**: Daily meetings and a Kanban board promote self-management and productivity.
  - **Better Quality**: Engagement in testing and development methodologies results in higher software quality.
  - **Reduced Time to Market**: Incremental work leads to faster deliverables and customer feedback.
  - **Increased Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Stakeholders see progress sooner, enhancing satisfaction.
  - **Improved Team Dynamics**: Transparency and collaboration create a productive development environment.
  - **Happier Employees**: Empowerment and control over work lead to happier team members.

## Scrum vs. Kanban
- Scrum and Kanban have differences:
  - **Cadence**: Scrum uses fixed-length sprints, while Kanban follows continuous flow.
  - **Release Methodologies**: Scrum releases at the end of a sprint; Kanban delivers continuously.
  - **Roles**: Scrum has defined roles (product owner, Scrum master, and development team), while Kanban typically has no roles.
  - **Key Metrics**: Scrum uses velocity, whereas Kanban uses cycle time.
  - **Change Philosophy**: Scrum prefers not to change sprint forecasts mid-sprint; Kanban embraces continuous improvement and change.

Upon completing this section, you will have a comprehensive understanding of Scrum artifacts, events, and the benefits it brings to software development.

# Section 7: Proper Organization for Agile Success

## Introduction
- In this section, you will learn:
  - How proper organization contributes to success.
  - Why teams should be aligned.
  - The importance of autonomy.
  - Why the entire organization must adopt Agile to be effective.

## The Impact of Organization
- Organization is a critical factor for success, and it often needs restructuring to achieve full agility.
- Conway's Law, dating back to 1968, states that an organization's communication structure influences system design.
- Teams should be loosely coupled with minimal dependencies but tightly aligned when building a single application.
- Each team should have a clear mission aligned with the business and end-to-end responsibility.

## Autonomy and Motivation
- Autonomy is essential for motivation and better outcomes.
- Teams should make decisions locally to prevent delays caused by hierarchical decision-making.
- Motivated teams build superior products and make faster progress.

## The Wall of Confusion
- The "Wall of Confusion" illustrates the conflicting metrics of development and operations.
- Development aims for change and speed, while operations prioritize system stability.
- These opposing views can hinder Agile success if not addressed.

## The Role of DevOps
- Entire organizations need to embrace Agile for it to be fully effective.
- DevOps aligns with Agile principles and goals.
- DevOps accelerates software delivery and improves responsiveness to change.
- It tightens the alignment between IT and business, increases productivity, and enhances system quality.

In this section, you've gained insights into the critical role of proper organization in Agile success, the value of team autonomy, and the importance of aligning the entire organization through practices like DevOps.

# Section 8: Understanding Agile Principles

## Introduction
- In this section, you will learn:
  - That Agile is more than just iterative development.
  - What Agile is not.

## Misconceptions of Agile
- Some organizations claim to be Agile but fall into a common pitfall.
- They engage in a "fuzzy front end," resembling traditional Waterfall practices, involving extensive planning and requirements.
- The development phase becomes iterative, but they fail to incorporate essential Agile principles.
- The last mile, deployment, becomes a challenge due to the lack of prior deployments, leading to a prolonged process.
- This situation is known as "Water-Scrum-Fall," where iterative development is mistakenly equated with true Agile practices.
- Being truly Agile involves more than iteration and requires customer feedback, adaptability, and quick deployment.

## What Agile Is Not
- Agile is not merely an iterative software development cycle resembling a mini Waterfall process.
- Agile is not restricted to developers working in sprints; it involves cross-functional teams comprising developers, testers, business analysts, and potentially operations personnel.
- Agile does not involve Agile project managers or a command-and-control approach.
- Agile teams are self-managed and assign work among themselves, which differs significantly from traditional project management.

In this section, you've gained insights into common misconceptions about Agile, understanding that true Agile practices involve more than just iterative development and require a cross-functional, self-managed approach.

# Module 2: Agile Planning and Iteration

## Section 1: The Pitfall of Upfront Planning

### Introduction
- After watching this section, you'll be able to:
  - Articulate why upfront planning leads to missed deadlines.
  - Summarize why iterative planning leads to greater accuracy.

In this section, we'll explore the challenges of upfront planning and the advantages of iterative planning in Agile.

### The Challenge of Missed Deadlines
- Douglas Adams humorously remarked, "I love deadlines. I love the whooshing sound they make as they fly by."
- Often, we set deadlines but end up missing them, and this is a common challenge.
- To avoid this, we need to navigate the unknown effectively.

### Navigating the Unknown
- Imagine navigating a field of penguins, with the goal of reaching the other side.
- Initially, you might make tentative steps, adapting to the penguins' movements.
- However, as you progress, your perspective changes, allowing you to plan your route more effectively.
- The lesson here is not to make all decisions when you know the least.
- Unfortunately, we often plan everything at the project's outset when our understanding is minimal.

### The Essence of Iterative Planning
- Agile promotes iterative planning, which involves planning as you go.
- Instead of deciding everything upfront, you plan based on your current knowledge.
- As you progress and learn more, you adjust your plan accordingly.
- This approach leads to more accurate estimates because you focus on what you know, not trying to predict the distant future.
- By embracing iterative planning, you can offer precise estimates for the near term, while acknowledging the uncertainty of long-term projections.

### Conclusion
- In this section, you've discovered that planning everything at the project's beginning can result in missed deadlines.
- On the other hand, iterative planning permits course corrections and enables more accurate project estimates.


## Section 2: The Pitfalls of Role Changes Without Training

- After going through this section, you will be able to:
  - Articulate why shifting individuals into new roles without adequate training can result in failure.

### Introduction

In this section, we will delve into a common pitfall organizations encounter when striving to embrace Agile methodologies: reassigning team members to new roles without providing them the essential training needed for success. We will explore the challenges this can pose and why it often leads to unfavorable outcomes.

### The Pitfall of Role Transitions

One significant misstep made during the transition to Agile is the reassignment of team members to new roles without offering the necessary training. Here are some examples of role changes that can cause difficulties:

#### 1. From Product Manager to Product Owner

- A Product Manager is typically a business-oriented role responsible for budget management and may have a high-level vision.
- In contrast, a Product Owner is a specific Scrum role tasked with guiding the team through experiments to achieve sprint goals.
- While there may be overlap between these roles in some cases, they often demand different skill sets, with the Product Owner focusing on the product's direction rather than budget management.

#### 2. From Project Manager to Scrum Master

- Project Managers usually excel at managing project plans and ensuring tasks adhere to these plans.
- A Scrum Master, however, serves as a coach and concentrates on maintaining a self-managed team free from external interruptions.
- Unlike Project Managers, Scrum Masters focus on eliminating impediments and supporting a self-managing team.

#### 3. From Development Team to Scrum Team

- A Development Team typically consists of software engineers and developers.
- On the other hand, a Scrum Team is cross-functional and includes developers, testers, security experts, business analysts, and operations professionals.
- The composition of a Scrum Team is crucial for constructing a complete product increment.

### The Necessity of Training and a Shift in Perspective

To prevent the negative consequences of role changes and ensure a smooth transition to Agile, it is imperative to provide the required training to align individuals with their new roles' responsibilities. Furthermore, the adoption of an Agile mindset involves not only altering roles but also changing the way management thinks.

This transformation is encapsulated in a quote from Bill Cantor: "Until and unless business leaders accept the idea that they are no longer managing projects with fixed functions, timeframes, and costs as they did with Waterfall, they will struggle to use Agile as it was designed to be used."

Upper management must shift its focus from long-term predictions to short-term, value-driven approaches. Instead of trying to forecast far into the future, they should ask teams what they intend to achieve in the next sprint.

## Section 3: Understanding Kanban Boards

- After completing this section, you'll be able to:
  - Describe what a Kanban board is and its purpose.
  - Explain the different pipelines or columns on a Kanban board.
  - Summarize how work progresses through a Kanban board.

### Introduction

In this section, we will explore the concept of Kanban boards, an essential tool for Agile planning and workflow management. Understanding what a Kanban board is and how it functions is crucial for effective project management and collaboration within Agile teams.

### The Significance of Agile Mindset

Before diving into the specifics of Kanban boards, it's essential to emphasize that Agile tools, including Kanban boards, are only effective when they are used in conjunction with an Agile mindset. The tool supports the Agile process, but the Agile mindset must come first. Attempting to make a Kanban board resemble a Gantt chart without adopting Agile principles can lead to confusion and inefficiency.

### Diverse Agile Planning Tools

The world of Agile offers a plethora of planning tools. While these tools share many common features, some are more complex than others. It's important to choose a tool that aligns with your specific needs. Some people prefer simplicity and opt for tools that only use epics and stories, avoiding tasks and subtasks as they might be considered too granular. In this course, we'll be using ZenHub, a plugin for GitHub, to illustrate Kanban board principles.

### Understanding ZenHub

ZenHub is an adaptable Agile project management tool that enhances your GitHub experience. It allows you to add Kanban boards to your GitHub projects, keeping everything in one place. This integration is particularly beneficial for development teams as they can manage projects and workflows directly within GitHub.

One of ZenHub's key features is its customization capabilities. While it starts with a set of columns (referred to as pipelines) for your Kanban board, you have the flexibility to tailor them to your team's specific requirements. This adaptability ensures that the tool can be as simple or as complex as needed. In this course, we'll emphasize the simplicity of using epics and stories.

### The Utility of ZenHub

ZenHub's power stems from its integration with GitHub issues. Issues in GitHub are used as stories in Agile development, which means developers work on these issues throughout the day. When they complete a task, they update the status directly within GitHub. This centralized workflow allows for real-time tracking without the need to navigate between multiple tools.

ZenHub's Kanban board offers a straightforward method to understand the progress of a project. It provides an up-to-date overview of all issues, their statuses, and which team members are actively working on them. This transparency is invaluable for management and stakeholders seeking to gauge the project's progress.

### What Is a Kanban Board?

A Kanban board is a visual representation of the work process. It's a tool that simplifies tracking planned work, work in progress, and completed work. While Kanban boards can vary in complexity, they all adhere to the basic principle of visualizing workflow stages to enhance efficiency and communication.

### The Structure of a Kanban Board

A typical Kanban board consists of several columns, each representing a different stage of the work process. These columns are often referred to as pipelines. While different teams may have variations in the number and names of their columns, the core concept remains the same. Here are the default pipelines in ZenHub:

1. **New Issues:** This column is like your inbox for new tasks. When an issue is created, it typically starts in this column. It's essential to triage and allocate new issues promptly to the appropriate pipelines.

2. **Icebox:** Unique to ZenHub, the icebox serves as a repository for items that are not immediate priorities. These are long-term tasks that are not actively being worked on.

3. **Product Backlog:** The product backlog houses all the tasks or issues that you intend to complete in the future. These are items that have not yet been scheduled for a sprint and remain on the to-do list.

4. **Sprint Backlog:** The sprint backlog contains the work planned for the upcoming sprint, typically the next two weeks. Items from the product backlog are moved to the sprint backlog during sprint planning.

5. **In-Progress:** Once a developer starts working on an issue, it is moved to the in-progress column. This signifies that active work is being performed on the task.

6. **Review QA:** In this column, tasks that are ready for review by peers or quality assurance (QA) teams are placed. It's a vital stage for ensuring the quality and completeness of the work.

7. **Done:** Finally, the done column indicates that the work is complete. While the development work is done, it doesn't necessarily mean the issue is accepted. Final validation often takes place during sprint reviews.

### Workflow on a Kanban Board

The flow of work on a Kanban board is straightforward, moving from left to right:

- **New Issues:** New tasks arrive here.
- **Icebox:** Items destined for a longer-term future.
- **Product Backlog:** All planned tasks not scheduled for the current sprint.
- **Sprint Backlog:** Work allocated for the upcoming sprint.
- **In-Progress:** Active work by developers.
- **Review QA:** Tasks ready for peer review and QA.
- **Done:** Completed tasks that have passed the development phase.

The Kanban board serves as a visual representation of the work's progress, making it easy to track the status of each task.

## Section 4: Understanding User Stories and Epics

In this section, you will learn about the essential concepts of user stories and epics in Agile project management. Upon completing this section, you will be able to:

- Define what a user story is.
- Describe the key components of a good user story.
- Explain the importance of adding acceptance criteria.
- Define the INVEST acronym for well-formed user stories.
- Understand what an Epic is and when to use it.

### Introduction

User stories and epics are fundamental building blocks in Agile project management. Understanding these concepts is essential for effectively documenting, prioritizing, and delivering software features or improvements. In this section, we will explore user stories and epics in detail.

### User Stories

**What is a User Story?**

A user story is a concise representation of a specific piece of business value that a development team can deliver within a single iteration or sprint. In Agile development, user stories have replaced traditional requirements documents, offering a more customer-centric and value-driven approach.

**Components of a Good User Story**

A well-formed user story should contain the following components:

1. **Who Is It For?**: Clearly define the persona or role for whom the feature or functionality is intended. This helps in understanding the user's perspective.

2. **What Do They Need?**: Specify the desired functionality or goal that the user is trying to achieve. This component describes the core of the story.

3. **Why Do They Need It?**: Explain the business value or benefits that the user will gain from having this feature or functionality. Understanding the "why" behind a story is essential for prioritization.

4. **Assumptions and Details**: Document any relevant assumptions, technical details, or additional context that may not be immediately obvious but are necessary for developers to understand.

5. **Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)**: This is the most critical component. It defines the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete. It helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that the feature meets the user's expectations.

**Acceptance Criteria Using Gherkin Syntax**

Acceptance criteria are often expressed using the Gherkin syntax, which makes it easy for both stakeholders and developers to understand and describe the desired behavior of the system. Gherkin syntax follows a structure:

- **Given**: The precondition or setup for the story.
- **When**: The action or event that occurs.
- **Then**: The expected testable result.

This structure ensures that everyone involved in the project comprehends the story's requirements and success criteria.

**The INVEST Acronym**

To create well-formed user stories, you can follow the INVEST acronym:

- **Independent**: User stories should ideally be independent, allowing them to be ranked and reordered without causing problems. While dependencies exist in some cases, strive to minimize them.

- **Negotiable**: User stories should be open to negotiation in terms of the implementation details. The goal is to find the right balance between user needs and technical considerations.

- **Valuable**: Every user story should provide value to the user or the organization. The business value should be clear, making it easier to prioritize stories.

- **Estimable**: User stories should be understandable enough to estimate. Team members should have a sense of the story's complexity.

- **Small**: User stories should be small enough to fit within a single sprint or iteration. This ensures that you can complete them within a reasonable timeframe.

- **Testable**: Each user story should have acceptance criteria that are testable. Testability helps avoid misunderstandings and ambiguities regarding what "done" means.

### Epics

**What Are Epics?**

Sometimes, user stories can be quite substantial, extending beyond the scope of a single sprint. When a user story is too large for a single iteration, it becomes an "Epic." Epics represent larger ideas or bodies of work that are broken down into smaller, manageable user stories.

**When to Use Epics**

- Epics are used when a user story is too large to be completed in a single sprint.

- Typically, backlog items start as big ideas or Epics. As you refine the backlog, you break them down into smaller user stories that can be addressed within a single sprint.

- Epics help you capture big ideas, such as major new features, system rewrites, or significant improvements, and then break them down into smaller, actionable stories.

By understanding user stories and epics, you gain a structured approach to manage the scope and value of your Agile projects. This ensures that the development team works on the most valuable features and that these features meet the expectations of the users and stakeholders.

## Section 5: Understanding Story Points

In this section, you will explore the concept of story points, a crucial metric used in Agile development. After completing this section, you'll be able to:

- Define what story points are and their abstract nature.
- Understand the components that contribute to story point estimates.
- Describe the importance of using relative scales for estimation.

### Introduction to Story Points

**What are Story Points?**

Story points are a metric used in Agile development to estimate the difficulty or effort required to deliver and implement a user story. User stories represent specific pieces of business value that need to be developed, and story points help teams gauge the level of effort needed for each story.

**Abstract Nature of Story Points**

It's important to understand that story points are an abstract measure. They do not equate to specific units of time like hours or days. Instead, they provide a relative value that indicates how one user story's complexity and effort compare to another.

### Components of Story Point Estimation

Several components contribute to story point estimates:

1. **Effort**: Story points consider the overall effort required to complete a user story. This includes the actual work involved in implementing the feature.

2. **Complexity**: Complexity is another factor. It assesses whether a user story is straightforward and simple or intricate and convoluted.

3. **Uncertainty**: The level of uncertainty about the story also plays a role. If a team is uncertain about a particular aspect of the story or if the story involves an entirely new task, it might be assigned more story points.

**Relative Scaling and T-Shirt Sizes**

To estimate story points, Agile teams use relative scaling rather than specific time units. Story points are often associated with T-shirt sizes (small, medium, large) or a Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). The use of these scales or sequences helps maintain the abstract nature of story points and allows teams to compare user stories' relative sizes.

**Challenges with Estimating Wall Clock Time**

Humans often struggle with estimating wall clock time. The habit of providing specific timeframes like "this task will take 3 days" can lead to inaccuracies and missed deadlines. Story points are deliberately abstract to avoid such pitfalls.

### Making Story Points Abstract

To make story points abstract:

1. **Agree on Relative Sizing**: The team needs to reach a consensus on what constitutes a "medium" or a "large" story. Once you have a reference point, you can compare other stories against it.

2. **Maintain Fuzziness**: Embrace a level of fuzziness. A story's size does not need to be precisely defined. It should be a rough estimate based on your agreed-upon reference point.

### Appropriate Story Sizes

User stories are ideally kept relatively small. A well-sized story should be something that a team can complete within a few days, promoting a sense of accomplishment and allowing for frequent releases. If a story is exceptionally large, it should be broken down into smaller stories to ensure it fits within a single sprint.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Evaluating Stories on Wall Clock Time**: One common anti-pattern is equating story points with specific time units (e.g., 1 point = 1 day). This approach negates the abstract nature of story points and is not in alignment with Agile principles. Avoid translating story points into fixed timeframes.

By understanding the abstract nature of story points and their relative scaling, Agile teams can effectively estimate the effort required for user stories and maintain a more flexible and accurate approach to project planning.

---

Story points offer a flexible and abstract method for estimating the complexity and effort of user stories. They serve as a valuable tool in Agile development, helping teams prioritize and plan their work effectively.

## Section 6: Building a Product Backlog

In this section, you will learn about the product backlog, an essential component of Agile project management. After  this section, you will be able to:

- Define what a product backlog is.
- Describe how to assemble and prioritize a product backlog.
- Convert requirements into user stories.

### Understanding the Product Backlog

**What is a Product Backlog?**

A product backlog is a critical element in the Scrum framework and Agile development. It represents a prioritized list of all the user stories that have not been implemented yet. These stories are waiting to be worked on in upcoming sprints.

**Ranking in Priority Order**

The product backlog is typically organized in ranked order, with the highest-priority stories at the top. Stories at the top of the backlog are often more accurately detailed compared to those at the bottom. It's important to prioritize stories in the backlog based on their business importance, ensuring that the most valuable features are tackled first.

### Assembling a Product Backlog

Now, let's consider an example to understand how to assemble a product backlog. In this scenario, we're developing a hit counter service. Users can name a counter, increment it, and check the current count. Here are the initial requirements:

1. **Need a service for counting things**: A basic counting service.
2. **Must allow multiple counters**: Users should be able to have several counters.
3. **Persist counters across restarts**: Counters should not be lost when the service restarts.
4. **Counters can be reset**: Ability to reset counters to zero when needed.

### Converting Requirements into User Stories

To create user stories from these requirements, use the following template:

- **As a [role]**: Describe who the story is for.
- **I need [function]**: Specify what functionality is required.
- **So that [benefit]**: Explain the business value gained from the functionality.

Here's how the requirements are converted into user stories:

1. **Need a service for counting things**:
   - **As a user**, I need a service that has a counter.
   - **So that I can keep track of how many times something has been done.**

2. **Must allow multiple counters**:
   - **As a user**, I need to have multiple counters.
   - **So that I can keep track of several counts at once.**

3. **Persist counters across restarts**:
   - **As a service provider**, I need a service to persist the last known count.
   - **So that users don't lose track of their counts after the service is restarted.**

4. **Counters can be reset**:
   - **As a system administrator**, I need the ability to reset the counter.
   - **So that I can restart counting from the beginning.**

### Prioritizing the Product Backlog

Once you have the user stories, you need to prioritize them in the product backlog. Consider the business value and urgency of each story. Place stories that are fundamental and have high business value at the top of the backlog. Those that can be addressed later can be ranked lower. The priority order may evolve as you gain more insights during the project.

This process helps you organize your work and ensures that the most valuable features are addressed first.

By understanding how to assemble, prioritize, and convert requirements into user stories, you can create a well-organized product backlog that serves as a valuable resource for Agile development.

---

The product backlog is a fundamental part of Agile project management, helping teams organize and prioritize their work. By following the steps outlined in this section, you can create an effective product backlog that drives your project's success.

## Section 7: Backlog Refinement

In this section, you will learn about the crucial process of backlog refinement in Agile project management. After this section, you'll be able to:

- Explain the process of backlog refinement.
- Describe how to run a backlog refinement meeting.
- Triage new issues on the Kanban board.

### Backlog Refinement Process

Backlog refinement, also known as backlog grooming, is the process of organizing and preparing the product backlog for future sprints. The goal is to have a well-organized and prioritized backlog, ensuring that all stories are small enough to fit in a sprint and have sufficient detail for developers to work on.

### Backlog Refinement Meeting

**Who Should Attend?**
- **Product Owner:** The key person responsible for creating and maintaining the product backlog.
- **Scrum Master:** Assists the Product Owner in backlog refinement.
- **Development Team:** While optional, having one or two technical team members can answer technical questions during the meeting.

**Meeting Goals:**
- Prioritize the backlog: Ensure the most important items are at the top of the backlog.
- Break down larger stories into smaller ones: Make sure all stories are sprint-ready.
- Provide sufficient detail: The goal is to have stories that are ready for sprint planning, reducing the need for detailed discussions during that meeting.

### Triage New Issues

**Handling New Issues:**
- New issues can come in at any time from stakeholders or customers.
- During the backlog refinement meeting, you should deal with these new issues in a process called "triage."

**New Issue Triage:**
- Start by emptying the new issue column on the Kanban board, treating it as your inbox.
- For each new issue, decide where it should go:
  - Move it to the product backlog if it's something to consider for the next sprint(s).
  - Place it in the icebox if it's a longer-term idea.
  - Reject it if it doesn't align with the project goals.

**New Issue Triaging Goals:**
- Ensure the new issue column is empty by the end of the meeting.
- Make decisions about the importance and alignment of new issues with the project.

### Completing the Story Template

To enhance the user stories, you can use a complete story template with the following elements:
- **As a [role]**: Specify who the story is for.
- **I need [function]**: Describe the required functionality.
- **So that [benefit]**: Explain the business value obtained.
- **Assumptions**: Include assumptions or prerequisites.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define specific conditions that should be met.
- **Definition of Done (DoD)**: Detail the criteria for considering the story complete.

**Examples of Enhanced User Stories:**
- Story: As a user, I need a service with an increment function, so that I can easily increase the counter value.
  - Assumptions: The increment operation should be atomic.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Given the counter is at 2, when I increment it, then the counter should return 3.
  - Definition of Done: The increment operation should be atomic and return the updated counter value.

By using the complete story template, you provide more clarity and ensure that stories are well-defined and ready for implementation.

---

Backlog refinement is a crucial process in Agile project management that helps ensure your project's success. By understanding how to triage new issues, prioritize the backlog, and create detailed user stories, you can effectively manage and organize your project's work.

# MODULE 3 - Daily Execution

## Section 1: Daily Workflow in Agile

In this section, you'll learn about the daily workflow in Agile project management, specifically in the context of Scrum. After this section, you will be able to:

- Describe the daily execution of work during a sprint.
- Determine which story you should work on next.
- Explain the importance of working on only one story at a time.

### Sprint Execution in Agile

A sprint in Agile is one iteration through the process of designing, coding, testing, and deploying. Sprints typically last for two weeks and are aimed at achieving specific goals. Every sprint should have a well-defined goal that guides the work during that period.

### Daily Execution

The daily execution of work in Agile involves the following steps:

1. **Take the Next Highest Item**: At the beginning of the sprint, team members should take the next highest item off the sprint backlog. The sprint backlog contains the stories that need to be worked on during the sprint.

2. **Assign the Story to Yourself**: It's crucial to assign the story to yourself. This helps in making it clear to the team that you're working on this story.

3. **Move the Story to "In Progress"**: Visualize your progress by moving the story from the sprint backlog to the "In Progress" column on your Kanban board. This makes it clear to everyone that you're actively working on the story.

4. **Complete the Story**: Your focus should be on completing the story, ensuring it meets the acceptance criteria and is ready to be reviewed.

### Using a Kanban Board

The Kanban board is a visual representation of your project's progress. It typically includes columns for "To Do," "In Progress," "Review QA," and "Done," among others. The board helps you keep track of which stories are at various stages of completion.

### Why You Should Work on Only One Story at a Time

Working on more than one story simultaneously can lead to inefficiency and reduced focus. It's essential to work on a single story at a time for several reasons:

- **Focus:** Working on one story allows you to concentrate your efforts, maintain focus, and deliver results more efficiently.

- **Efficiency:** Completing one story before moving on to the next ensures that you can ship fully completed features. Working on multiple stories simultaneously could lead to a situation where none of them are fully completed by the end of the sprint.

- **Visibility:** When each team member works on one story at a time, it's easier for the team and management to track progress and understand who is responsible for each task.

- **Blocked Stories:** In the rare event that you encounter a blocking issue or dependency while working on a story, you may temporarily shift your focus to another story while the impediment is resolved. However, this should be an exception rather than a common practice.

Working on one story at a time aligns with Agile principles and promotes better collaboration and productivity within the team.

---

In Agile project management, maintaining a consistent daily workflow is crucial to ensure effective progress. This includes assigning and completing one story at a time to maintain focus and maximize efficiency throughout the sprint.

## Section 2: The Daily Stand-Up Meeting in Agile

In this section, you'll learn about the daily stand-up meeting in Agile project management, also known as the daily scrum. After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Describe what happens in the daily stand-up meeting.
- Discuss the importance of time boxing the meeting to 15 minutes.
- Explain what to do with topics raised at the meeting.
- Conduct a daily stand-up meeting.

### The Daily Stand-Up Meeting

The daily stand-up meeting, or daily scrum, is a fundamental component of the Agile development process, particularly in Scrum. This daily meeting serves several important purposes, including keeping the team informed and addressing any impediments promptly.

Key points regarding the daily stand-up meeting:

1. **Frequency and Consistency**: The daily stand-up meeting should occur at the same place and time every day, ideally without variations. This consistency helps the team plan their schedules accordingly.

2. **Name**: While some call it the "daily scrum," others refer to it as the "daily stand-up." Both terms are commonly used. The choice of terminology may vary among teams, but the essence of the meeting remains the same.

3. **Team Focus**: The meeting is primarily for the development team, which includes software engineers, testers, and anyone directly involved in the development process. It's a forum for the team to share updates with each other.

4. **Time Box**: The daily stand-up meeting is strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. This time limit is crucial to ensure that the meeting is efficient and does not disrupt the team's workflow. Standing during the meeting is one way to enforce this time constraint.

### Attendance

- **Scrum Master**: The Scrum Master's presence is essential at the daily stand-up. They are responsible for facilitating the meeting and ensuring that the team's needs are met. The Scrum Master also helps remove impediments if any team member reports being blocked.

- **Development Team**: All members of the development team, including software engineers, testers, and others, should attend the daily stand-up.

- **Product Owner**: The Product Owner may attend the meeting, but their participation is optional. If they do attend, they should refrain from speaking unless necessary. This is not a status meeting for the Product Owner, but rather for the development team.

### The Three Questions

During the daily stand-up, each team member answers three key questions:

1. **What did I get done yesterday?**
2. **What am I going to work on today?**
3. **Are there any blockers or impediments in my way?**

These questions help team members update each other on their progress, plan their work for the day, and highlight any issues that need immediate attention.

### Handling Tabled Topics

Any topics or discussions that arise during the stand-up and are not directly related to the three questions should be tabled or "parked" for later discussion. The Scrum Master should note these topics and address them separately after the 15-minute stand-up meeting concludes.

This approach helps maintain the focus and efficiency of the daily stand-up, ensuring that the primary goal of sharing updates and addressing impediments is achieved within the time frame.

In summary, the daily stand-up is a brief, daily meeting that promotes communication within the development team, allows for quick issue resolution, and ensures everyone is aligned on the team's progress. It is crucial to keep it focused, time-boxed to 15 minutes, and avoid turning it into a status meeting.

---

The daily stand-up meeting is a cornerstone of Agile methodologies and plays a vital role in maintaining the team's synchronization and efficiency. Time boxing it to 15 minutes and addressing topics separately contribute to its effectiveness in Agile development.

## Section 3: Understanding Burndown Charts in Agile

In this section, you'll gain an understanding of burndown charts in Agile project management. After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Define a burndown chart.
- Describe how to read a burndown chart.
- Explain how burndown charts can help forecast the team's ability to achieve the sprint goal.

### What Is a Burndown Chart?

A burndown chart is a visual representation of a team's progress during a sprint or a milestone in Agile development. It provides a clear and simple way to track the completion of tasks or story points over time.

Key points about burndown charts:

1. **Measure of Progress**: Burndown charts track the number of story points (or tasks) completed versus the number of story points remaining within a defined time frame.

2. **Adaptable Milestones**: While burndown charts are typically associated with sprint planning and execution, they can be used to measure progress against any milestone, not just sprints. For example, a milestone might be a demo preparation, a conference presentation, or any significant goal with a defined scope.

### Reading a Burndown Chart

Burndown charts typically feature the following elements:

- **Vertical Axis**: Represents the number of story points in the sprint or milestone. This number is specific to each sprint or milestone and can vary between teams and projects.

- **Horizontal Axis**: Represents the number of days within the sprint. The length of a sprint may vary, but a common duration is two weeks.

- **Vertical Bars**: These bars indicate weekends. They help visualize the sprint's duration and account for non-working days (typically weekends).

- **Optimal Path**: The chart plots an ideal path or trendline that represents a consistent and perfect rate of task completion throughout the sprint. This path can be thought of as the "ideal" rate at which work should be finished.

- **Blue Line**: The blue line represents the actual progress. Each dot on the blue line corresponds to a closed or done story. The slope of this line provides real-time insight into how well the team is performing compared to the ideal path.

### Forecasting with Burndown Charts

Burndown charts are essential for forecasting a team's ability to achieve the sprint goal. Here's how they help with forecasting:

- **Early Tracking**: At the start of a sprint, the team can track their progress on the burndown chart daily. It helps identify whether they are on track to complete all committed stories by the end of the sprint.

- **Mid-Sprint Adjustments**: If the blue line starts to deviate from the ideal path, it's a signal that the team might not achieve the sprint goal if they maintain the same pace. In such cases, teams can make adjustments, like reprioritizing or reassigning work, to get back on track.

- **Course Correction**: The burndown chart offers the team an opportunity for course correction. They can monitor their performance and rally to complete stories before the sprint's end.

- **Sprint Review**: By the end of the sprint, the burndown chart shows whether the team achieved their sprint goal. If the blue line meets or is below the ideal path, it's a good indication that the team has completed their work as planned.

In summary, burndown charts are an invaluable tool in Agile project management. They provide a visual representation of progress, helping teams forecast their ability to achieve sprint goals. By comparing the actual performance (the blue line) to the ideal path, teams can make timely adjustments and ensure a successful outcome.

---

Burndown charts offer a quick and intuitive way for Agile teams to monitor their progress and adapt to achieve their sprint goals. Understanding these charts is essential for effective sprint management and forecasting.

## Section 4: Sprint Review in Agile

In this section, you'll learn about the sprint review in Agile project management. After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Describe what a Sprint review is.
- Explain who to invite to a Sprint review meeting.
- Describe how to conduct a sprint review meeting.

### What Is a Sprint Review?

The sprint review is a critical event in the Scrum framework, occurring at the end of each sprint. It is essentially a demo session where the development team showcases the features and functionality they have implemented during the sprint. The primary goals of a sprint review are to:

- **Demonstrate Progress:** Developers present the work they have completed to all stakeholders, allowing them to see tangible results.

- **Gather Feedback:** The sprint review is a two-way communication session. Stakeholders, including the product owner, provide feedback on the delivered functionality.

- **Inspect and Adapt:** Based on the feedback received, the team can identify necessary changes, improvements, or new requirements for the product backlog.

### Who Should Attend a Sprint Review Meeting?

The sprint review meeting should be an open event attended by a diverse group of participants, including:

1. **Product Owner:** The product owner plays a central role in defining requirements and expectations. They need to assess whether the delivered work aligns with the product vision.

2. **Scrum Master:** The scrum master, who is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process, ensures that the event runs smoothly and helps address any impediments.

3. **Development Team:** Developers who have worked on the sprint's tasks showcase their accomplishments and answer questions.

4. **Stakeholders:** This includes anyone with a vested interest in the project, such as managers, team members from other departments, and external partners.

5. **Customers:** If applicable, direct users or customers of the product can offer invaluable insights.

### Conducting a Sprint Review Meeting

Here are the steps to effectively conduct a sprint review meeting:

1. **Demo the Work:** The development team presents the completed stories or features. These should be live demonstrations to give everyone a clear understanding of the functionality.

2. **Seek Feedback:** After each demo, open the floor to feedback and questions. The product owner, stakeholders, and customers can provide input on the work presented.

3. **Discuss Feedback:** Engage in discussions about the feedback received. This may include clarifications, suggestions for improvements, or changes to the product backlog.

4. **Decide on Next Steps:** Based on the feedback, the team should decide whether new stories need to be added to the product backlog or if existing ones need to be updated.

5. **Move Stories to Closed:** Stories that have been successfully demonstrated, met acceptance criteria, and received approval are moved from the "Done" column to the "Closed" column in the project management tool or on the Kanban board.

6. **Handle Rejected Stories:** Stories that do not meet acceptance criteria should not be moved to the next sprint as they impact the team's velocity. Instead, they should be closed, and new stories can be created based on the feedback for the next sprint.

In summary, the sprint review is a crucial Agile event that provides a platform for showcasing work, obtaining valuable feedback, and ensuring that the product aligns with stakeholders' expectations. The feedback received during the sprint review helps in shaping the future direction of the project, making it a fundamental part of iterative and adaptable development.

---

The sprint review meeting is a dynamic and interactive session that facilitates the demonstration of completed work and enables valuable feedback from stakeholders. It plays a vital role in ensuring that the product aligns with expectations and remains adaptable to evolving requirements.

## Section 5: Sprint Retrospective in Agile

In this section, you'll learn about the sprint retrospective in Agile project management. After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Describe what a Sprint retrospective is.
- Explain who to invite to a Sprint retrospective meeting.
- Describe how to conduct a Sprint retrospective meeting.

### What Is a Sprint Retrospective?

The sprint retrospective is a crucial meeting in the Scrum framework that occurs at the end of each sprint, following the sprint review. It's a dedicated time for the team to reflect on the sprint that has just concluded. The primary purpose of a sprint retrospective is to review the team's performance during the sprint and identify areas for improvement. The retrospective is a key component of Agile's continuous improvement philosophy.

### Who Should Attend a Sprint Retrospective Meeting?

The sprint retrospective meeting typically involves the following participants:

1. **Scrum Master:** The Scrum Master plays a key role in facilitating the retrospective and ensuring it remains focused and productive.

2. **Development Team:** All members of the development team actively participate in the retrospective, sharing their observations and insights.

3. **Product Owner:** While not usually present in the retrospective, there can be exceptions. If the product owner's presence doesn't hinder an open and honest discussion, they may attend. However, the absence of the product owner is often preferred to encourage the development team to speak candidly.

### Conducting a Sprint Retrospective Meeting

A sprint retrospective meeting follows a structured format to ensure a productive review of the sprint. This involves three key questions:

1. **What Went Well:** The team begins by discussing the positive aspects of the sprint. These are the things that went smoothly, improvements that have been made, or any achievements.

2. **What Didn't Go Well:** In this segment, the team openly discusses challenges, bottlenecks, or any issues that occurred during the sprint. It's crucial to foster an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their concerns.

3. **What Will We Change:** This is the most critical part of the retrospective. The team identifies and agrees upon concrete actions and changes that need to be implemented in the next sprint to address the issues discussed earlier.

Here's how to conduct a sprint retrospective:

1. **Create a Safe Environment:** The Scrum Master should emphasize the importance of a non-blaming and open atmosphere. Team members should feel free to speak their minds without fear of repercussions.

2. **Keep It Time-Boxed:** A typical sprint retrospective should be time-boxed to about 1-3 hours, depending on the length of the sprint and the complexity of issues discussed. It should not drag on endlessly to maintain energy and focus.

3. **Focus on Action:** The primary goal is to identify actionable changes to improve the next sprint. The Scrum Master should document these actions and ensure they are prioritized and assigned to team members.

4. **Review Previous Actions:** If there were actions from the previous retrospective, the team should review whether they were implemented and their effectiveness.

5. **Follow Up:** The Scrum Master or team members should track and follow up on the actions between retrospectives, ensuring that improvements are being implemented.

6. **Iterative Improvement:** The retrospective is not a one-time event. It's a continuous process of reflection and improvement. The team should consistently strive to make each sprint better than the last.

In summary, the sprint retrospective is an opportunity for the development team to self-reflect, identify areas for improvement, and take action to enhance their processes and collaboration. It is a fundamental practice for fostering continuous improvement in Agile development.

## Section 6: Agile Metrics and Continuous Improvement

In this section, you'll learn about Agile metrics and how they can be used for continuous improvement in Agile project management. After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Describe the difference between vanity metrics and actionable metrics.
- Describe the top four actionable metrics.
- Explain how metrics can be used to improve the team's performance.

### Vanity Metrics vs. Actionable Metrics

Metrics are essential in Agile project management for measuring progress, identifying areas for improvement, and making data-driven decisions. However, not all metrics are created equal. There's a critical distinction between "vanity metrics" and "actionable metrics."

**Vanity Metrics:** Vanity metrics are superficial data points that may look impressive but lack real value in guiding decision-making. For example, counting the number of website hits or downloads without understanding user behavior or conversions. These metrics can be misleading and do not provide actionable insights.

**Actionable Metrics:** Actionable metrics, on the other hand, provide meaningful, specific, and actionable insights. These metrics are tied to concrete outcomes, helping teams understand what needs to change and how to improve. Actionable metrics are key for continuous improvement.

### Top Four Actionable Metrics

1. **Mean Lead Time:** Mean lead time measures the time it takes for an idea or a piece of work to go from inception to delivery to the customer. This metric is crucial for understanding how efficiently the team can deliver value. Reducing mean lead time can lead to quicker delivery and increased customer satisfaction.

2. **Release Frequency:** Release frequency indicates how often a team can release new features or updates to the product. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to release constantly, but it's about having the capability to release when needed. High release frequency enables quicker responses to customer needs.

3. **Change Failure Rate:** Change failure rate measures the percentage of changes or releases that result in failures or issues, such as bugs or downtimes. Reducing the change failure rate is essential for maintaining a stable and reliable product. Lowering this rate ensures that releases are less disruptive and costly.

4. **Mean Time to Recovery:** In the past, organizations focused on preventing failures, but it's inevitable that failures will occur. Mean time to recovery measures how quickly a team can recover from failures. A shorter recovery time means that the impact of failures is minimized, leading to higher product availability and customer satisfaction.

### Using Metrics for Continuous Improvement

Metrics play a vital role in the Agile process for continuous improvement:

1. **Establish Baselines:** To improve, you need to know where you currently stand. Set baselines by measuring key metrics before any changes are made.

2. **Set Goals:** Determine what specific changes or improvements you want to achieve. For example, if your mean lead time is currently 10 days, you may set a goal to reduce it to 2 days.

3. **Measure Progress:** Continuously measure and monitor the selected metrics against the baselines and goals. Are you making progress, staying the same, or getting worse?

4. **Take Action:** Use the insights gained from your metrics to identify areas for improvement. Then, take concrete actions to address these areas. For instance, if your change failure rate is high, investigate the root causes and make necessary changes in your processes.

5. **Iterate:** Continuous improvement is an ongoing process. After taking action, review the impact of the changes and iterate on them. Are you achieving the desired results? If not, adjust your actions accordingly.

By focusing on actionable metrics, teams can identify specific areas for improvement, set goals, and work towards becoming more efficient, reliable, and responsive to customer needs. Metrics provide the data-driven feedback necessary for Agile teams to evolve and consistently deliver value to their stakeholders.

## Section 7: Closing a Sprint and Preparing for the Next

In this section, you'll learn about the activities involved in closing a sprint in Agile project management and how to prepare for the next sprint. After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Close out the sprint on the Kanban board.
- Describe how to handle unfinished stories.
- Prepare for your next sprint.

### Closing a Sprint

Closing a sprint involves several essential activities to ensure a smooth transition to the next phase of your project.

1. **Move Completed Items:** Take all the items that are in the "Done" column of your Kanban board and move them to the "Closed" column. This step ensures that completed work is officially closed and acknowledged.

2. **Close the Sprint Milestone:** If you are using a milestone to track your sprint (common in GitHub or other project management tools), ensure that you close out the current sprint's milestone. It's important for maintaining accurate velocity on your charts. Some tools might automatically close a sprint milestone based on its end date, but verify that it's closed, especially if you run late in completing the sprint.

3. **Create a New Sprint Milestone:** While you might choose to create a new sprint milestone during the next sprint planning meeting, you can also prepare by creating it at the end of the current sprint. This is where you'll track the work for your upcoming sprint.

### Handling Unfinished Stories

Unfinished stories fall into two categories:

1. **Untouched Stories:** These are stories that no one worked on during the sprint. You have the flexibility to decide whether these stories are still a priority. Rather than automatically moving them to the next sprint, consider evaluating whether they are still relevant based on current priorities. If they are relevant, move them to the top of the product backlog.

2. **Partially Completed Stories:** Some stories may have been worked on but not finished during the sprint. It's essential not to move these stories directly into the next sprint, as doing so would affect your velocity. Instead, consider the following approach:
   
   - Adjust the Story Points: If the initial estimation was incorrect, adjust the story points to reflect the work done.
   - Close the Story: Close the partially completed story for the current sprint to get credit for the work done.
   - Create a New Story: Write a new story for the remaining work that needs to be completed. Place this new story in the product backlog.

By following these steps, you can maintain an accurate velocity and track the actual work completed in each sprint. It's important to recognize and close out partially completed stories to reflect the true progress of your team.

### Preparing for the Next Sprint

As you prepare for the next sprint, ensure that all current stories are assigned to the completed sprint and closed. This step keeps your Kanban board tidy and your metrics accurate.

All unfinished stories should be reassigned as described in the previous section. Ensure that any stories that were in the previous sprint's milestone are taken out of it and moved to the product backlog. At this point, you can decide whether to create a new sprint milestone for the upcoming sprint or do so at the start of the next sprint planning meeting.

In summary, closing a sprint and preparing for the next involves closing out the current sprint's work, handling unfinished stories appropriately, and creating a new milestone for the upcoming sprint. These steps help maintain accurate metrics and ensure that your Agile team is ready for the next cycle of work.

## Section 8: Scrum Anti-patterns and a Health Checklist

In this section, you'll learn about some common anti-patterns to avoid when practicing Scrum and a checklist to measure the health of a Scrum team. After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Recognize and discuss anti-patterns in Scrum.
- Understand what makes a Scrum team healthy.

### Scrum Anti-patterns

**1. No Real Product Owner:** One common anti-pattern is the absence of a clear product owner. In some teams, it's unclear who the product owner is, leading to a lack of direction and vision for the team. A dedicated and clear product owner is crucial for a successful Scrum team.

**2. Multiple Product Owners:** Having multiple product owners can lead to conflicting priorities and a lack of a unified vision for the team. Ideally, there should be a single product owner who sets the vision for the product.

**3. Large Teams:** Scrum teams should be small and ideally consist of five to nine members. Teams larger than this can lead to communication challenges and inefficiencies.

**4. Teams Not Dedicated:** If team members are working on multiple projects simultaneously, it can negatively impact their focus and effectiveness. Dedicated team members are more likely to deliver high-quality work within a sprint.

**5. Geographically Dispersed Teams:** Scrum works best when teams are co-located. Geographically dispersed teams may face communication challenges and delays in collaboration.

**6. Siloed Teams:** In Scrum, teams should be cross-functional and self-contained. If a team is dependent on other teams to complete their work, it's considered an anti-pattern. Teams should aim to work independently and not rely on external dependencies.

**7. Non-Self-managing Teams:** Scrum teams should be self-managing and self-organizing. They should have the autonomy to decide how to complete their work within a sprint. Teams that are too heavily directed or micromanaged do not exhibit the self-management required by Scrum.

### Scrum Team Health Checklist

Here's a checklist to assess the health of your Scrum team:

**1. Accountability:** Everyone in the team should be accountable for their work and feel ownership of the tasks they're assigned.

**2. Small Sprints:** Sprints should be relatively short, ideally two to four weeks, to promote faster iterations and adaptability.

**3. Ordered Product Backlog:** The product backlog should be well-organized and prioritized, making it clear which items should be addressed next.

**4. Sprint Backlog:** A clear sprint backlog should be available, allowing the team to visualize the remaining work in the sprint.

**5. Sprint Planning and Forecast:** Before starting a sprint, the team should create a sprint backlog and plan the work to be done during that sprint.

**6. Done Increment:** At the end of each sprint, there should be a potentially shippable increment of the product that can be demonstrated.

**7. Stakeholder Feedback:** Stakeholders should provide feedback during sprint reviews, helping to steer the product in the right direction.

**8. Updated Product Backlog:** The product backlog should be updated based on the feedback and insights gained during sprint reviews.

**9. Alignment:** The product owner, development team, and Scrum master should be aligned on the work in progress and should collaborate closely to improve sprint after sprint.

By recognizing anti-patterns and using this checklist, you can work towards ensuring a healthier and more effective Scrum team. Following Scrum principles and practices is essential for successfully implementing Agile project management.
